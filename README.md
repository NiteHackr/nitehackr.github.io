Personal webpage to showcase some of my work.

This is a simple website, one I create a long time ago.  It contains mostly older style HTML, nothing fancy, probably some deprecated ways of doing things so I definitely wouldn't use this to learn off of; unless of course older HTML webpages interests you.

I use some simple code for detecting mouse clicks etc.  All fairly simple, but it works.  Maybe someday I will learn more advanced website design but this works for now.

Besides, given the classic nature of my game Deluxe Pacman 1 & 2, it only stands to reason that the website should also have a classic look and feel to it.  That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it! ;)

I have a GAMES section, though there's only one complete game in there at the moment.  I have a programming section, that is rather old these days with some REALLY old projects I used to work on but never finished.  I could fill up that section with unfinished projects and ideas I think!  The BLOC! game works fine as is though.
