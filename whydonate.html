      <p>I create games like Deluxe Pacman because it is really fun to create
        a good looking game and know that people around the world are
        enjoying themselves as a result of my work.  It is also fun to mess
        around with graphics, sound effects etc... and to give back to the
        freeware-community something.</p>
      <p>And, of course, its nice to see all the positive (and some negative) 
        feedback about my creations. And, for example to see Deluxe Pacman at 
        Game Hippo's number 1 in the popular download section twice, makes me
        a little bit proud.</p>
      <p>On the other hand it's sometimes just (hard and boring) work. There 
        is a gap between having a nice idea and testing out that it works 
        <i> <b>and</b></i> providing a end-user compatible working solution, 
        test it on different operating systems, keep it updated and fixing 
        all the major and minor things that went wrong. </p>
      <p>And providing all the writings and web pages. Quickly answering
        emails, too.</p>
      <p>So a donation keeps my moral high, my fridge stocked with diet cola
        and Deluxe Pacman (and other titles) running in the future.<br>
