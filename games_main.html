v18.03.21 (1441): Enabled Joystick support again.<br>
v18.03.11 (2310): Updated the Website button and recompiled with a more updated library and compiler.<br>
v17.07.14 (1401): There was a bug discovered this the last version where if you selected suicide mode in the options, you could not turn it off again! So I fixed that and it will properly toggle back off again. &nbsp;I also added in 5 new levels so the maximum now goes up to 45. &nbsp;This version was also compiled with a newer version of the compiler and library I used to program it with.<br>
v17.05.07 (1925): Several changes to this version. &nbsp;I added 10 new levels, the maximum level is now 40. &nbsp;of course, you can always add more of your own levels and go higher if you wish. &nbsp;I also went over some of the game's data and dramatically reduced the size of it all. &nbsp;The quality is still unchanged, but it may result in slightly improved performance and use less memory when run. &nbsp;You will notice the ZIP file you download is now almost half the size it used to be, this is normal. &nbsp;I have also updated the game and recompiled it with newer more up to date software that the game is created with. &nbsp;All in all, I am quite pleased with this release. &nbsp;I hope you enjoy it.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;I am releasing the source code for Deluxe Pacman 2 and the level editor under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a> which is pretty open. &nbsp;I hope someone does something with this, I put notes and other info in the doc folder of this zip. &nbsp;I would put this up on github the normal way, but I honestly never used it much so I don't know much about how, if someone else wishes to do that, it would be great. &nbsp;For now, I just zipped it all up with notes etc. &nbsp;It's all ready to be loaded up and compiled with Code::Blocks, you just need the latest Allegro 5 + it's dependencies to be able to compile it. &nbsp;The download link for the dependencies needed is now available below this. &nbsp;Have fun.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to also include the dependencies which include all the libs that allegro needs, and my own person precompiled Allegro 5 libs which you will need to compile Deluxe Pacman 2.<br>

Pacman 1 - v1.99d</h2> (Windows/XP/Vista/7/8/10)<br>
(v1.99d)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;There were some errors with the last version. &nbsp;I made some mistakes and somehow didn't statically link parts of the game like I should have and as a result, the game reports various missing files if you tried to play it. &nbsp;I fixed this and tested it before I uploaded it here to be certain, so this should now work just fine for you (famous last words). &nbsp;My apologies for any problems. &nbsp;This was a minor oversight with huge problems, that's always the way it seems to go; the little things get you.<br>
(v1.99c)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Updated the Website button and changed the PACE level editor so it runs in a window rather than fullscreen. &nbsp;It looks a little small as a window, but given the age of this game, the fulscreen resolution it uses may no longer be supported by some video cards. &nbsp;The editor for this version is honestly horrible, but I won't update it as there is Deluxe Pacman 2 now with a very nice editor. &nbsp;This is mainly for anyone who really wants to use this. &nbsp;The bonus is that the main game and editor have been recompiled fresh which may or may not help it run for some.<br>
(v1.99b)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed some bugs, the game will now scan for custom levels when it is first run and use them for the JUMP tool if there are a lot. &nbsp;It would not use them beyond the normal game limit (117) before. &nbsp;I also fixed a couple other minor bugs I discovered. &nbsp;There is one that remains which I cannot fix because it has nothing to do with my own code, but has to do with either an older library I use (Allegro 4) or Windows itself changed something. &nbsp;It's a minor annoyance where you experience a long delay when you quit from fullscreen mode. &nbsp;This doesn't happen from windowed mode though. &nbsp;There's literally nothing I can do about it. &nbsp;This problem doesn't exist in Deluxe Pacman 2 (above) as it uses a newer version of the library. &nbsp;This will most likely be my final update on this version as I really dislike working on it.<br>

Pacman 1 - v1.22</h2> (Windows/95/98/XP)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This is an older version of the game that runs in 8bit (256 color) mode on Windows. &nbsp;This will probably NOT look good on Windows 7+ by default, you'll have to set the compatibility properties of the executable to use 256colours and 640x480 for it to work. &nbsp;It DOES work well on Windows XP and earlier though, I tested it before uploading to be certain.<br>

Pacman 1 - v1.02</h2> (DOS)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the last version I compiled for DOS.  If you have trouble with the Windows versions above, or just want to check this out, download and install <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a> then run this from within <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a> (a freely available DOS emulator).  Odds are pretty good it will run for you and you'll get a look at one of the older versions, it will looks similar and plays about the same.<br>
