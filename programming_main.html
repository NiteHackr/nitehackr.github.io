<h1>PROGRAMMING:</h1>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is basically a collection of programs you can download and try out that I have worked on. &nbsp;Some may be games, others are projects I have worked on in order to learn how to program certain things like 3D and what not. &nbsp;None of it is guaranteed to work on your system, but it all worked for me at the time it was compiled, so if you're curious as to what I am up to, feel free to check this out. &nbsp;All of these programs were created using freely available software, just google "free compilers" for example, or use google to search for various free programming tutorials, there is a lot out there, these days you can dive right in, create your own programming masterpiece without spending a dime on software.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another 3D program I am playing around with. &nbsp;This one I am seriously considering making it into a game (unlike Test3D which I used just for testing my 3D programming). &nbsp;There isn't much to it yet, it's still VERY basic, but I thought I would put it up anyhow just for fun. &nbsp;Read the City3D.txt file in the zip for more info about keys etc. &nbsp;This program was programmed without the use of any libraries, just Windows code and OpenGL, that's it, so I'm quite proud of it for that reason.<br>
<br>
SCREENSHOT: The resolution will now use whatever your desktop resolution is for fullscreen mode, for windowed mode it will use 1280x???, the window mode depends on your screen ratio, so a monitor with 16:9 ratio will have a 1280x720 window, a monitor with 4:3 ratio will have a 1280x1024 window. &nbsp;This is left over code from my old full screen mode it still uses for windowed mode.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been working on learning to program OpenGL. &nbsp;As I learn I add to a little 3D program I created. &nbsp;So far it has terrain, a nice sky, some trees etc... and it is available for download for anyone who is curious, you can move around it and do whatever I feel like adding to it, just read the text file that comes with it for details.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little 2D game I work on every once in a while. &nbsp;My original idea was to have a really HUGE map that would take you a long time to explore it all. &nbsp;I haven't done up a proper level for it yet, it is just a huge grassy map with two roads, but I have the graphics ready for a map, I just want to create an editor (in the works) for it. &nbsp;You can drive the tank around, turn the turret seperatly from the body, fire the gun etc. &nbsp;There isn't much to it yet, but I thought I would throw it up just to show some of the ideas I have. &nbsp;I have some other projects I will probably add to this page as well. &nbsp;I wouldn't mind hearing from people about which one of these they are most interested in me completing, I have a couple more I will add soon.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little tetris like game that is almost complete. &nbsp;It has ingame music while you play and with every line you get, it reveals part of an image underneath the blocks! &nbsp;You complete the level when you have the entire image displayed. &nbsp;This is an ALPHA version of the game, it is almost complete and is fully playable, it is only missing the title screen, various menus, high score and setup screens etc. &nbsp;When complete it will be shareware (yet still fully playable with no time limits or anything like that). &nbsp;Anyhow, check out the screenshot below, download the game and let me know what you think.<br>
