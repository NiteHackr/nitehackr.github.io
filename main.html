      <h3>April 18, 2024 @4:31pm</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I haven't posted on here for a very long time now, but I wanted to let people know what has happened to me. &nbsp;In March of 2021 my wife Wanda (pictured above), the one whome I made "Deluxe Pacman" for, suddenly had a ministroke. &nbsp;It only lasted a minute or so, but subsequent scans revealed that she had cancer. &nbsp;Within six months of that initial stroke, she breathed her last and died on September 21, 2021. &nbsp;I have been devestated as we knew each other since my teens and married when I turned 20 in 1985. &nbsp;She was the world to me, we were married almost 37 years. &nbsp;I cried daily for the first year and a half and on and off since then. &nbsp;Losing your spouse after together so long, saying "I love you" daily is worse than anyone could imagine. &nbsp;Anyhow, not to depress anyone, but I wanted to let you all know what has happened. &nbsp;If it wasn't for Wanda, I would never have made the game. &nbsp;Her picture is in the credits of Deluxe Pacman 2, beside her best friend, who I still talk to. &nbsp;I have thought about recreating a third version of the game, a "memorial" edition in memory of her. &nbsp;I'm still uncertain as my enthusasiam and general motivations in life seems to have left me; time will tell. &nbsp;Anyhow, love you all, thanks to the few that donated. &nbsp;Trust me, I could never have lived off the donations for this! &nbsp;Hehehe... not that I done it for the money, I did not. &nbsp;I may have gotten $10 a year on average, if that. &nbsp;But no, I done it for her and can't wait until I see her again in Christ's kingdom, God willing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have a spouse, make certain you tell them you love them daily as you never know when they will be taken away someday. &nbsp;My final words to Wanda was "I love you" and hers to me was "I love you too", two days later she stopped breathing.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Deleted all my Facebook accounts, including my Deluxe Pacman page there. I can no longer, in good concious support a platform that restricts freedom of speech like they do. I am currently on MEWE, though I have no plans to create a page for the game yet.<br>

      <h3>March 17, 2018 @11:46am</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I resurrected this website from the dead (great time of the year to do it too, the passover just around the corner). &nbsp; I was informed by a friend about this website where I could bring my homepage back and have it hosted here, so here I am. &nbsp; Hopefully this one won't vanish on me again. &nbsp; I'll work on getting this back running with updates of the games. &nbsp; I may just redsign this page as well for the new site, we'll see, this is a pretty old look.<br>
