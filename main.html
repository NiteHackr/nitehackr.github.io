&nbsp; &nbsp; I resurrected this website from the dead (great time of the year to do it too, the passover just around the corner). &nbsp; I was informed by a friend about this website where I could bring my homepage back and have it hosted here, so here I am. &nbsp; Hopefully this one won't vanish on me again. &nbsp; I'll work on getting this back running with updates of the games. &nbsp; I may just redsign this page as well for the new site, we'll see, this is a pretty old look.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Deluxe.Pacman" target="_top">Official Deluxe Pacman Facebook page</a>: Beware of frauds, this is the ONLY page I authorize, other pages may contain hacks, viruses, malware, adware etc, mine does not, if you wish to keep updated, like it. &nbsp;It's also the fastest way to message me as I am on there daily and will generally respond within a few hours of any questions you have. &nbsp;I'm easy to get along with and will do just about anything to help (if you treat me with respect that is).</dd>
