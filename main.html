 &nbsp; &nbsp; Updated the GAMES page, added in a gameplay video of Deluxe Pacman 2, removed gameplay video and screenshots for Deluxe Pacman 1 as they are way out of date, and I do not support that game anymore, version 1.99 is the final version of it, I decided to keep the older, classic graphics on it, as that is how that game was designed. &nbsp;If you want newer graphics, give Deluxe Pacman 2 a try.<br>
